# `first-tree breeze`

Local daemon that takes over your `gh` login and turns explicit GitHub review
requests and direct mentions into a triaged, optionally auto-handled inbox.
Drives a Claude Code statusline, an SSE dashboard, and scheduled background
work.

## Commands

### Primary

| Command | Role |
|---------|------|
| `first-tree breeze install --allow-repo owner/repo` | Check `gh` / `jq` / auth, create `~/.breeze/config.yaml`, and start the daemon. Statusline hook wiring is a separate manual step. |
| `first-tree breeze start --allow-repo owner/repo` | Launch the daemon in the background |
| `first-tree breeze stop` | Stop the daemon and remove its lock |
| `first-tree breeze status` | Print current daemon/runtime status |
| `first-tree breeze doctor` | Diagnose daemon / gh login / runtime health |
| `first-tree breeze watch` | Interactive TUI inbox (Ink) |
| `first-tree breeze poll` | One-shot inbox poll without requiring the daemon |

### Advanced / internal

| Command | Role |
|---------|------|
| `first-tree breeze run --allow-repo owner/repo` / `first-tree breeze daemon --allow-repo owner/repo` | Run the broker loop in the foreground |
| `first-tree breeze run-once --allow-repo owner/repo` | Run one poll cycle, wait for drain, then exit |
| `first-tree breeze cleanup` | Clear stale state |
| `first-tree breeze statusline` | CLI shim that executes the pre-bundled `dist/breeze-statusline.js` hook |
| `first-tree breeze status-manager` | Internal helper used by breeze runners |
| `first-tree breeze poll-inbox` | Legacy alias for `poll` |

Run `first-tree breeze --help` for the authoritative list.

Daemon-starting commands (`install`, `start`, `run`, `daemon`, `run-once`)
must be given `--allow-repo <owner/repo[,owner/*,...]>` so breeze never
falls back to scanning every notification on the account.

## Runtime Constraints

`engine/statusline.ts` is bundled separately (`dist/breeze-statusline.js`) and
is called every few seconds by the Claude Code statusline hook. It must stay
zero-dep and cold-start under 30ms — do not import `ink`, `zod`, or the
umbrella CLI from it.
